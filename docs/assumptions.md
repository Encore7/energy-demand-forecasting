# Assumptions & Constraints

## Data Assumptions
- Demand data may arrive late or out-of-order
- Weather forecasts are probabilistic and imperfect
- Small inaccuracies are acceptable at intraday scale

## Modeling Assumptions
- Baseline models provide acceptable performance
- Intraday models correct residuals, not replace baselines

## Operational Constraints
- Local development environment
- Open-source tooling only
- Cloud deployment is optional, not required
